# twitter_disaster_classifier
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify tweets as disaster-related or not, based on their text content. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze the text and trains several machine learning models to predict the classification of each tweet.
